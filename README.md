  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alex Castillo, 

I know how to work, learning fast new tools and paradigms collaboratively, using all the experience I gained through life experiences, and of course coding every day at Microverse, with a high amount of other developers around the world. Complying with the deadlines.

Just started the Miccroverse program, I notice the importance of learning and adapting to new languages and developing paradigms, and that allow me to create a lot of capstone projects in Javascript, HTML, CSS, and some frameworks related to that.

With my professional experience, even itâ€™s not related to software development, I learned to lead collaborative teams, to achieve goals, until keeping constant learning to myself and all the team's members.

Since my father passed away, and in my home the economy was very bad, I noticed, that every resource is important, and every time I try to save resources, not only talking about the economic ones but also resources like time, effort, etc. but never losing focus on the main goal.
