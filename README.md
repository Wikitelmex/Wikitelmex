## Who am I?
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alex Castillo, 

I know how to work, learning fast new tools and paradigms collaboratively, using all the experience I gained through life experiences, and of course coding every day at Microverse, with a high amount of other developers around the world. Complying with the deadlines.

Just started the Miccroverse program, I notice the importance of learning and adapting to new languages and developing paradigms, and that allow me to create a lot of capstone projects in Javascript, HTML, CSS, and some frameworks related to that.

With my professional experience, even itâ€™s not related to software development, I learned to lead collaborative teams, to achieve goals, until keep an constant learning to me and all the teams members.

Since, my father passed away, and in my home the economy was very bad, I noticed, that every resource is important, and everytime I try to save resources, not only talking about the economic ones, but also resources as time, effort, etc. but never losing focus on the main goal.

## What jobs/goals that I'm prospecting?
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a full stack interested in developing with HTML, CSS, JS, Ruby and RoR, however, I love to develop APIs with dotnet, and front-end with Angular.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently at Microverse Program, developing every day in a collaborative environment 5 days at week, to reach a knowledge about collaborative developing teams, with people all around the world.
